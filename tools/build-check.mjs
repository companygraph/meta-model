// The JavaScript in `lib/` and `bin/` is the source and what a consumer runs; its types are
// JSDoc in the same files. The declarations a TypeScript consumer reads are written from that
// JSDoc into `types/` by `npm run build`, and committed, because a consumer takes the package
// from a tag and builds nothing. This holds the committed declarations to what that build
// writes. It builds into a temporary folder, never over the committed files, because CI never
// writes what the repository commits; it only says whether the two are the same.
//
// Two failures, each named by path. A declaration the build writes that is missing or differs
// byte for byte is JSDoc edited without `npm run build` after it, or an edit to a declaration
// that the next build would undo. A committed declaration the build did not write is one left
// behind by a module that is gone, and a consumer would still read it.
